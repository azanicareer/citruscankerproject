Welcome to our AI-powered solution designed to detect and combat citrus canker, a prevalent disease impacting citrus crops globally.

## The Problem

The Florida wine industry generates approximately $7 billion for the Florida economy.

Citrus canker poses a significant threat to citrus trees, leading to blemished leaves, reduced yields, and economic losses for farmers. Traditional detection methods often fall short, requiring time-consuming visual inspections.

</p>



## Our Solution

Our project leverages cutting-edge AI technology, specifically the AlexNet convolutional neural network, to accurately identify healthy citrus leaves from those affected by citrus canker in real-time. By analyzing leaf images, our system provides rapid and precise detection, enabling early intervention and preventive measures.

## Advantages of Early Detection üçÉ

* **Improved Crop Health:** Timely identification of citrus canker helps maintain the health of citrus plants, allowing for appropriate and swift action to mitigate the disease's impact. 

* **Cost Efficiency:** Early detection reduces the need for extensive treatments or replacing numerous plants affected by citrus canker, resulting in cost savings for farmers.

* **Consistent Quality:** Identifying and removing diseased leaves ensures that healthy ones are utilized, contributing to the overall quality of the citrus yield.

* **Preventing Spread:** Promptly addressing citrus canker limits its potential spread to nearby plants, safeguarding the health of the entire citrus orchard.

* **Reduced Food Waste:** Early detection prevents the development of unattractive lesions on fruit, ensuring that citrus crops meet supermarket standards and reducing the likelihood of rejection, minimizing food waste.


## Pairing with Drone Technology

To extend our solution's capabilities, we integrate our citrus canker detection software with drone technology for real-time field surveillance. Drones equipped with our AI software conduct aerial surveys, capturing images of citrus groves. When diseased leaves are detected, the software triggers alerts with precise GPS coordinates.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes AlexNet for high-accuracy identification of citrus canker.
- **Drone Integration:** Seamless pairing with drones for aerial surveillance.
- **Location-Based Alerts:** Instant alerts with GPS coordinates for targeted action.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use and seamless integration.
- **Data Analytics:** Access comprehensive analytics for informed decision-making.
