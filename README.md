Welcome to our AI-powered solution designed to detect and combat citrus canker, a prevalent disease impacting citrus crops globally.

## The Problem

The Florida wine industry generates approximately $7 billion for the Florida economy.

Citrus canker poses a significant threat to citrus trees, leading to blemished leaves, reduced yields, and economic losses for farmers. Traditional detection methods often fall short, requiring time-consuming visual inspections.

### Healthy citrus leaf


## Our Solution

Our project leverages cutting-edge AI technology, specifically the AlexNet convolutional neural network, to accurately identify healthy citrus leaves from those affected by citrus canker in real-time. By analyzing leaf images, our system provides rapid and precise detection, enabling early intervention and preventive measures.

## Pairing with Drone Technology

To extend our solution's capabilities, we integrate our citrus canker detection software with drone technology for real-time field surveillance. Drones equipped with our AI software conduct aerial surveys, capturing images of citrus groves. When diseased leaves are detected, the software triggers alerts with precise GPS coordinates.
